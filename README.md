## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT – demonstrating how to create a prompt-based assistant that helps organize daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.

---

##  AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT  
- Lovable AI *(optional for simulation)*  

---

##  Explanation
This experiment focuses on building a **personal productivity assistant** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as ChatGPT.  
The assistant manages tasks, sets reminders, gives wellness tips, and answers user queries naturally.  
It also adapts to user preferences over time using interactive feedback and memory simulation.

---

##  Prompt

Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks,
schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.
The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable
to the user’s changing preferences over time.


---

##  Procedure
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.  
2. Construct suitable prompts for each function using ChatGPT.  
3. Simulate user interaction through a simple interface or command-line tool.  
4. Collect user feedback and adapt responses dynamically.  
5. Add memory to simulate user preference learning.
